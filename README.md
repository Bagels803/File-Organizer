# File-Organizer
just a simple file organizer...

setup:

1. Rename the folders that you can sort items into to what ever you want. put a underscore after what you remaned it to (remember name for later)

2. Go into the Customization.txt file and list out your folder names.
ex: (put this into square brackets -- > -- > "YourFolderName1_", "YourFolderName2_" 

3. The items you want to sort must start with that folder name. 
ex: you want to sort 3 types of docs. 1: tax, 2: health, 3: insurance. name the prefix of your file that folder name

4. put your files into the input folder and press sort.
